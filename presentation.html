<h1> A brief introduction to PHP and JavaScript </h1>


<h3> JavaScript </h3>

<p> 

Java Script was developed in September of 1995 by a programmer by the name of Brendan Eich over a period of 10 days, and was orginally known as Mocha. It became known as live script, but the dev team changed the name to Javascript inan attempt to connect the new language with the popular Java language.[3] Java needed a scripting language and javascript was designed with that in mind.[2] Eich was contracted to build a language that looked like Java, but had the simplicity and power of another language Scheme. These were contridictary goals, and Eich managed to achieve them by taking the control structures of Java and the Core functionality of scheme.[2]

<h3> PHP </h3>
	
<p> 

Rasmus Lerdorf developed PHP in 1994 from C. His goal was to replace the Perl code he had been using in his personal webpage. He would go on to publically release the language in 1995.[4] While Javascript was released as a client side language PHP was released as a server side language.[4] Yet it would not be until 1997 when the syntaxtical analyzer was restructured that it began to gain wide acceptence.[1] Then in 1998 when Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans release version 3 of PHP it was renamed Hypertext Processor and PHP gained its modren popularity.[4]
